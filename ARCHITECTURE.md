# Auracrab Architecture

Auracrab is an autonomous, persistent AI agent daemon built in Go, designed to act as a proactive "Digital Butler" for systems engineering and life management. It operates as a background service, leveraging long-term vector memory and stateful "Thought Signatures" to maintain context across multi-step tasks.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Engine (Go-Native)
- **Runtime**: Orchestrates the hybrid model strategy.
- **Thought Signatures**: Uses Gemini 3’s stateful context to maintain permanent reasoning chains.
- **Memory**: Long-term vector storage for context retrieval across sessions.

### 2. Orchestration Layer
- **Planning**: Utilizes GitHub Copilot SDK for repository-wide analysis and planning.
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Leverages OpenAI’s AgentKit for complex handoffs.
- **Integration**: SaaS and third-party integrations via a centralized Connector Registry.

### 3. Real-time Monitoring & Feedback
- **Live Analysis**: Uses Gemini Multimodal Live API to "watch" terminal outputs and screen feeds.
- **Autonomous Recovery**: Detects and resolves build failures or system errors in real-time.

### 4. Communication Interface
- **Messaging-First**: Always-on, interruptible interface via Telegram or Signal.
- **Transport**: OpenAI’s Realtime API and Gemini’s low-latency WebSockets.

### 5. Environment & Tooling (MCP)
- **MCP Host**: Implements the Model Context Protocol to bridge the agent with the environment.
- **Local Access**: Deep integration with local system utilities.
- **Managed Tools**: Connection to Google Search, Workspace, and other cloud-based MCP tools.

### 6. Security & Sandboxing
- **Isolation**: Go-native sandboxing layer using system-level isolation (e.g., Bubblewrap) for security.
- **Tool-Calling Loops**: All commands generated by the agent are executed within this restricted environment.

## Directory Structure (Current)

- `cmd/auracrab/`: Application entry point.
- `internal/cli/`: Cobra-based command definitions.
- `internal/tui/`: Bubble Tea interactive interface.
- `pkg/core/`: Core business logic and agent primitives (planned).
- `pkg/sandbox/`: Sandboxing and security implementations (planned).
- `pkg/mcp/`: Model Context Protocol implementation (planned).
